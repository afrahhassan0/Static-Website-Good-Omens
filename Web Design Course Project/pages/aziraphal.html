        <p>What do you expect when you hear the word angel? Do you think about a creepy gigantic winged creature or maybe an arrogant egoistic being who thinks hes better than humans? If so, then you'll be surprised with our Aziraphale.</p>
        <p> He is an angel who doubles as a rare book dealer. He's looking to prevent the apocalypse because he enjoys humans and he likes his life on Earth. There are restaurants on here, for a start. Furthermore, he does not find the idea of listening to The Sound of Music for eternity very appealing. He is best friends with the demon <a href="./crowley.html">Crowley</a></p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Aziraphale was sent to guard the Garden of Eden with a flaming sword but later gave it to Adam and Eve when they were thrown out of Eden. As Aziraphale watched the two depart into the wilderness he first met <a href="./crowley.html">Crowley</a> who had transformed himself into a snake to tempt Adam and Eve. The pair wondered whether they had done the right thing - giving up the sword - and the wrong thing - tempting Adam and Eve - respectively. After being asked, Aziraphale reluctantly told Crowly he had given up his sword, much to the latter's amusement, and they watched Adam use it to fend off a lion. Aziraphale sheltered Crawly with his wing from the rain beginning a 6000 year old friendship between the two.</p>
        <p>He doesn't like people buying his books, and has a load of weird methods to chase away customers.</p>
        <p>As stated in the novel, Angels and Demons have no inherent gender or sex, however they can choose a gender if they so please. Although it's never explicitly stated that Aziraphale identifies as a man, he consistently presents himself as a male and uses he/him pronouns.</p>
