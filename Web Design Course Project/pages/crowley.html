                <p>Demons, the evilest creatures to enter this earth, born only to cause distruction and sin... But is this really what they always want to do, for eternity? Well, Crowley doesn't</p>
                <p>Crowley didn't so much fall from Heaven so much aps "saunter vaguely downwards". He has snake eyes — and a penchant for designer sunglasses. He's the snake that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, naturally.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Not much is known about Crowley before he Fell, though he does make a few references to his time as an angel. It's implied that he joined Lucifer’s Rebellion because he was bored or Fell because he asked too many questions about God's Great Plan.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Crowley is overall a non-threatening demon. He somewhat attempts to be evil in his own way, but is actually quite morally decent in human terms. He objects to the killing of innocent people and animals and wants to save the world, albeit for his own reasons. He has a flair for the dramatic and can be a heavy drinker. He seems to not take his job seriously and doesn't really partake in "normal demon" things. Most of his "accomplishments" were faked or done by humans, which he considers better at making their own lives miserable than he is. He thinks of himself as evil, but is usually a minor inconvenience at worst.</p>
